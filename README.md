$ I am Ethan Johnson. I'm from MN now residing in AZ. Some hobbies include, basketball, cryptocurrency , and just creating things. \
$ My goals are to be able to enjoy using my time while also benefitting humanity, as well as be financially free by age 25. \
$ At the moment I've chosen FINTECH as my career path because I see not just a source of income, but I also find the practical knowledge and skills to be useful.
